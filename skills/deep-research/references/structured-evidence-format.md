# Structured Evidence Format

A lightweight intermediate representation for research evidence, inspired by
the sn-deep-research architecture (OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-Skills) but adapted
for single-agent use without the full 9-role pipeline.

## When to Use

- Reports with 5+ sources
- Comparison or fact-check categories
- When the user may want to verify claims
- When fabrication prevention matters (research informing decisions)

Skip for quick 2-3 source reports — the overhead isn't worth it.

## Claim Rules

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `factual` = verifiable stat (needs ≥1 primary/secondary source). `interpretive` = analysis (needs ≥2 different sources). `projective` = prediction (needs stated assumptions). **No normative claims** ("should/must") — research states facts, not opinions. |
| `polarity` | `support` = supports the hypothesis. `refute` = counter-evidence. `neutral` = descriptive. **At least 1 refute claim is required** — refute=0 means biased research. |
| `snippet` | Must be exact text from the fetched source, NOT reconstructed from memory. This is the fabrication-detection mechanism. |
| `source_quality` | `primary` = official docs, model cards, SEC filings, original papers, vendor pricing pages. `secondary` = tech journalism, analyst reports, benchmarks aggregator. `tertiary` = Wikipedia, forum posts (Reddit, HN), blog aggregators, social media. |
| `topic_tag` | Reuse existing tags when possible. Same topic = same tag. |

## Source Quality Ranking and Weighting

Source quality is not just a label — it determines **evidentiary weight** when sources conflict or when claims rest on a single source.

### The ranking hierarchy

| Tier | Weight | Examples | When it wins |
|---|---|---|---|
| **primary** | 3× | Official docs, model cards, SEC filings, API pricing pages, original research papers, vendor spec sheets | Always preferred for factual claims. A single primary source outweighs multiple tertiary sources. |
| **secondary** | 2× | Tech journalism (TechCrunch, Ars Technica), analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), benchmark aggregators (Artificial Analysis) | Reliable for synthesis and interpretation. Needs ≥2 independent secondary sources to match 1 primary. |
| **tertiary** | 1× | Reddit, HN, forum posts, Wikipedia, blog aggregators, social media | Useful for community sentiment, real-world anecdotes, and gap-filling. **Never the sole support for a factual claim if a primary/secondary source exists.** Best used to surface counter-evidence (refute polarity) or document real-world experience that primary sources don't cover. |

### Conflict resolution by quality

When sources disagree on a fact:

1. **Primary > secondary > tertiary.** If a vendor pricing page says $5/1M tokens and a Reddit post says $3/1M, the pricing page wins. Present the tertiary view as "community reports suggest X, but official pricing confirms Y."
2. **2 secondary ≈ 1 primary.** Two independent secondary sources corroborating each other match the weight of one primary source.
3. **Tertiary cannot override secondary/primary.** A Reddit anecdote contradicts an official spec sheet → the spec sheet wins; the Reddit post becomes "refute" counter-evidence or writing_context, not the basis for the factual claim.
4. **Tertiary is valuable for refute polarity.** Community sources often surface real-world problems (latency, break-even misses, hidden costs) that official sources won't acknowledge. Use tertiary for refute claims and writing_context, not for the main factual claims.

### Quality distribution check (during evidence review)

Before writing the report, check the source quality distribution:

- **Healthy**: ≥30% primary, ≤30% tertiary. Evidence base is strong.
- **Acceptable**: ≥1 primary for key factual claims, <50% tertiary. Note as a gap if primary coverage is thin.
- **Weak**: 0 primary sources, >50% tertiary. **Flag explicitly in the Gaps section** — the evidence base rests on secondary/tertiary interpretation, not direct sources. Attempt to fetch primary sources (official docs, model cards, pricing pages) before finalizing the report.

### Weighting in the report

When citing sources in the final report:
- State the quality tier in the source table (already required).
- When a claim rests primarily on tertiary sources, qualify it: "Community reports suggest..." or "According to forum discussions..." — don't present tertiary-sourced claims with the same confidence as primary-sourced claims.
- When sources conflict, present the higher-weight source as the primary finding and the lower-weight as the counter-evidence or context.

## Writing Context vs Claims

- **Claims** = facts about the research subject (numbers, events, states, trends)
- **Writing context** = boundary conditions (scope limits, methodology notes,
  availability gaps, unresolved uncertainties) — NOT facts, but things the
  writer needs to acknowledge when presenting facts

This separation prevents the report from overstating certainty. A gap in
available data is not a claim — it's writing context.

## Worked Example (from July 2026 side-by-side test)

Research question: "Best open-weight LLMs for 5GB RAM CPU-only server?"

13 claims, 9 sources, 1 refute claim, 2 writing_context items.

Key finding: the refute polarity requirement forced a search for
counter-evidence to "GLM-5.2 is impossible on CPU" — which found a Reddit
thread showing GLM-5.2 CAN run on CPU, just needs 192-256GB RAM (not 5GB).
This nuance would have been missed without the refute requirement.

## Side-by-Side Test Results (July 2026)

| Metric | Iterative loop only | + Structured evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Final report words | 1,307 | 1,255 |
| Inline citations | 10 | 40 (claim ID refs) |
| Source quality tiers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Refute polarity | ❌ | ✅ (1 explicit refute) |
| Gaps section | ❌ | ✅ (3 documented) |
| Contradictions section | ❌ | ✅ (1 tension surfaced) |
| Fabrication detectability | Low | High (snippet in JSON) |
| Traceability | Citation → URL | Claim ID → snippet → URL |
| Artifacts | 1 file | 2 files (evidence.json + report) |
| Total output bytes | 8,473 | ~20,000 |

**Conclusion:** Structuring evidence before writing adds ~2.5× output overhead
but produces materially higher quality: explicit gaps, forced counter-evidence,
source quality awareness, and full traceability. The full multi-agent pipeline
(scout → research → review → planner → writer → stitcher) is NOT needed — the
evidence.json layer alone captures ~80% of the quality gain at ~20% of the
complexity cost.

## Second Validation: Multi-Dimensional Topic (July 2026)

A deeper test ran the v1.2.0 methodology end-to-end on a 5-dimension research question: *"Self-hosted vs cloud API for AI agents in 2026: when does self-hosting become cheaper — considering hardware depreciation, electricity, capability parity, and operational overhead?"*

**Results:** 15 claims, 10 sources, 4 refute-polarity claims, 3 writing_context items. 3 research rounds, 9 queries, ~6 minutes.

**What this validated beyond the first test:**

1. **Refute polarity scales with topic depth.** The first test (LLM comparison) produced 1 refute claim. This deeper topic produced 4 — the r/LocalLLaMA $6.4K server counter-analysis, the "API rates are subsidized" argument, the talent-cost trap, and the latency penalty. The refute requirement forced engagement with the strongest counter-arguments, not just the supportive ones.

2. **Contradictions section captured genuine tension.** Three sources gave different break-even points (50M vs 30M vs "never" tokens/month). Without the structured contradictions section, these would have been smoothed into a single number. The synthesis explained *why* they differ (utilization patterns), which is more honest and more useful than picking one.

3. **Writing context separated facts from boundary conditions.** Three items: regional cost variance (scope), talent cost region-dependence (methodology), and "no CPU-only break-even exists" (availability gap). These aren't claims — they're caveats the reader needs to interpret the claims correctly. This distinction prevented overstating certainty.

4. **Source quality revealed a weakness.** 0 primary sources (all secondary/tertiary). The gaps section flagged this explicitly. A single-pass report would not have surfaced this evidence-strength limitation.

5. **Overview-first report structure worked at scale.** The comparison-at-a-glance table (11 rows × 4 columns) right after the executive summary gave the complete answer in one screen. The 6 detailed sections below were supporting reasoning. The user confirmed this structure is preferred.

**Cost overhead:** evidence.json was 18.6KB + report 14KB = ~33KB total, vs ~14KB for a single-pass report. ~2.4× overhead for materially higher quality (explicit gaps, forced counter-evidence, source quality awareness, full traceability). Worth it for research informing decisions; skip for quick lookups.

## Third Validation: Source Quality Ranking Stress Test (July 2026)

A third test ran the v1.3.0 methodology (with source quality ranking) on: *"Is RAG obsolete in 2026? Long-context windows vs retrieval-augmented generation for AI agents — when does each approach win?"*

**Results:** 15 claims, 6 sources, 5 refute-polarity claims, 3 writing_context items. 3 research rounds, 7 queries, ~5 minutes.

**Source quality distribution: 4 primary (67%), 2 secondary (33%), 0 tertiary (0%) — healthy.**

This was the first test where the quality distribution check deliberately drove the search strategy. Knowing the check was coming, the search targeted arXiv papers and vendor research blogs first, not tech journalism. Results:

| Metric | Test 1 (LLMs 5GB) | Test 2 (Self-host vs API) | Test 3 (RAG vs LC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary sources | 1/9 (11%) | 0/10 (0%) | **4/6 (67%)** |
| Secondary | 7/9 (78%) | 7/10 (70%) | 2/6 (33%) |
| Tertiary | 1/9 (11%) | 3/10 (30%) | **0/6 (0%)** |
| Distribution | Acceptable | **Weak** (flagged) | **Healthy** |
| Refute claims | 1 | 4 | 5 |

**What this validated:**

1. **The quality distribution check actively steers search strategy.** When the agent knows it must report the distribution (healthy/acceptable/weak), it prioritizes primary sources (arXiv, vendor research) over secondary blogs. Test 2 landed at "weak" (0 primary); Test 3 landed at "healthy" (67% primary) because the search was deliberately structured to find primary sources.

2. **Tertiary sources are not always needed.** Test 2 used Reddit for refute counter-evidence (appropriate). Test 3 found all refute evidence in primary research (Chroma's context rot, arXiv papers) — zero tertiary needed. The methodology doesn't force tertiary; it forces the right tier for each claim type.

3. **Conflict resolution by quality applied in practice.** When NIAH scores (vendor-cited, secondary) conflicted with RULER scores (NVIDIA research, primary), the report presented RULER as the stronger finding and NIAH as the limited benchmark — per the "primary > secondary" rule. This wasn't abstract; it resolved a real source conflict.

4. **Weighting notes per claim tier.** The report explicitly stated which claims rest on which tier: core accuracy findings on 3× primary arXiv papers, cost figures on 2× secondary (with a gap note that the exact 1,250× multiplier is secondhand). This gives the reader evidence-strength transparency that a flat source table doesn't.

5. **Contextual AI bias acknowledged.** The "RAG is irreplaceable" claim came from Contextual AI (founded by the RAG inventor) — primary authority with an inherent pro-RAG bias. The report noted this and corroborated with independent arXiv papers and adoption data. Primary sources can be biased too; the weighting system handles this via corroboration requirements.

**Key lesson:** The source quality ranking is not just a labeling exercise — it changes how the agent searches, how it resolves conflicts, and how it presents evidence strength. The distribution check (healthy/acceptable/weak) is the enforcement mechanism that makes the ranking actionable.

## What NOT to Adopt from sn-deep-research

- **Full 9-role multi-agent dispatch** — 9 agent invocations = massive token/latency overhead. Our single-agent loop with evidence.json is sufficient.
- **Content-addressed source snapshots** — good for institutional research with link-rot risk, overkill for everyday reports. The snippet field in evidence.json provides adequate fabrication detection.
- **Python validator scripts (40 rules)** — too heavy. A mental checklist during review is enough: every claim has a real snippet? refute count ≥1? sources classified?
- **Separate format-discovery skill** — our 6-category detection (comparison/product/how-to/fact-check/explainer/factual) is simpler and self-contained.
- **Perspective/supplement loops** — adds 2-3 extra rounds for marginal quality gain on typical tasks.
